## Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently intrigued by **generative models** especially diffusion models.
  - âš¡ Currently study Differential Geometry from the [book](https://julianchaidez.net/materials/reu/lee_smooth_manifolds.pdf) written by John Lee.
  - âš¡ Interested in SDEs and neural ODEs.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in stochastic trajectories generation and simulation. (self-driving)

Interested fields:
- Flow-based models
- Stochastic Differential Equations, Random processes
- Invariant and equivariant networks
- Graphical models
- Elements in Causal Inference
